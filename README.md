# utfpr_tictactoe

### A Variation of the Tic-Tac-Toe Game

In this version of Tic-Tac-Toe, we have:

* 3 players, using the symbols **X**, **O**, and **+**
* a **4×4 board**
* players can place their symbol **on top of another player's symbol**
  * However, there is an **anti-revenge rule**: if, in the previous move, **X** placed a symbol over **O**, then in **O**'s next turn, they **cannot** place their symbol over **X**.

### How to Run

To run the game:

- Generate utfpr_tictactoe using mix escript

### How to Play

1. When you start the game, each player will choose their symbol (x, o, or +)
2. The symbols must be different for each player
3. The game will display the 4×4 board
4. Players take turns to place their symbols on the board
5. To make a move, enter the position in format: row,column (e.g., 1,1 or 2,3)

#### Revenge not allowed - example 1

1. **X plays on (1,1)** — X on empty cell — ✅ valid move  
2. **O plays on (1,1)** — O overwrites X — ✅ valid move  
3. **+ plays on (1,1)** — + overwrites O — ✅ valid move  
4. **X plays on (1,1)** — X overwrites + — ✅ valid move  
5. **O plays on (1,1)** — O overwrites X — ✅ valid move  
6. **+ plays on (2,2)** — + on empty cell — ✅ valid move  
7. **X plays on (1,1)** — ❌ invalid move: X is retaliating against O’s overwrite in move 5, violating the anti-revenge rule
